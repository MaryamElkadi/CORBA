# CORBA


The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is a middleware specification that facilitates communication between distributed objects in a networked environment. Defined by the Object Management Group (OMG), CORBA provides a platform-independent and language-independent framework for building applications that rely on distributed objects. CORBA enables seamless interaction between objects written in different programming languages and running on different operating systems.

CORBA provides a powerful framework for building distributed systems with objects that can communicate across different platforms and programming languages. Through its components, such as IDL, ORB, and Object Services, CORBA helps developers build robust, scalable, and interoperable distributed applications. It is especially useful in environments where different systems need to work together seamlessly, regardless of the underlying hardware or software architecture.
